This is based on the Blocks Dashboard Theme for Bootstrap, by Carlos Alvarez.  

The original example is index2.html, which uses main2.css 

The new smoker control front end is index.html and main.css

On iOS, open the page in safari, hit share, and select "add to homescreen".  This makes an app icon on your homescreen that will open the page full screen, without safari controls.

The android analog to this should work as well, but I can't test that.

On Desktop, the Auto button in the webapp itself toggles fullscreen mode
